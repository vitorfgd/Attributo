    "summary": "Attributo: Pro License Manager Attributo is an Editor-only Unity tool that automates asset attribution and third-party license compliance. By linking folders to license data and tracking imports, it helps keep your project audit-ready and simplifies generating attribution documents (e.g. ThirdPartyNotices.txt or CREDITS.md). Features Import-time prompts – When you add assets under an unlicensed folder, a wizard appears so you can assign or create licenses. Hierarchical licensing – Place a License Link in a folder; that folder and its children inherit that license until overridden by another link deeper in the tree. SPDX integration – Fetch official license text from SPDX by entering an identifier (e.g. MIT, Apache-2.0) in the License Data inspector. License Hub – Central window to audit all links and export a single attribution file with deduplicated license text and notes. Mute folders – Optionally mark a folder as “no license needed” so the import detector does not prompt again for that path. Quick links User manual – Setup, workflows, and troubleshooting (same content as the package README). Scripting API – API reference for the Attributo and Attributo.Editor assemblies. Technical note Attributo is Editor-only. The Runtime assembly (Attributo) contains only data types (LicenseData, LicenseLink). All hierarchy resolution and Asset Database usage live in the Editor assembly (Attributo.Editor), so the package has no impact on player builds or build size. Legal disclaimer Attributo is an organizational aid and does not constitute legal advice. You are responsible for verifying that all assets are correctly attributed and that license terms are followed. Always review exported attribution files before shipping."

    "title": "Attributo: Pro License Manager – User Manual | Attributo: Pro License Manager Documentation",
    "summary": "Attributo: Pro License Manager – User Manual Thank you for choosing Attributo. This tool is designed to automate the tedious process of asset attribution and legal compliance within Unity. By documenting your licenses at the moment of import, you ensure your project is always \"audit-ready.\" 1. Quick Start First-Time Setup Import the Package: Once imported, Attributo is active. You don't need to toggle any settings. The Licenses Folder: It is recommended to keep all your LicenseData assets in a central folder (e.g., Assets/Licenses). The Import Workflow When you drag a new asset (model, texture, audio, etc.) into your Assets folder: Automatic Detection: Attributo checks if the folder (or its parents) already has a license. The Wizard: If no license is found, a window will appear. Select: Choose an existing license from your library. Create: Quickly generate a new license template. Mute: If the asset is your own work, click \"Skip (Mute folder)\" to create an empty link and stop future prompts for that directory. 2. Managing Licenses (LicenseData) LicenseData assets are the heart of the system. They store the legal \"identity\" of an asset. Using the SPDX Fetcher Create a new LicenseData asset (Create > Attributo > License). Enter the SPDX Identifier (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0, CC-BY-4.0). Click \"Fetch Official SPDX Text\" in the Inspector. Attributo will download the official legal text and populate the license field. Unique Attributions If you have two different assets that both use the MIT license but require different author credits: Create two separate LicenseData assets. Name one MIT_Envato_Skybox and the other MIT_GitHub_InventorySystem. Use the Notes field to store specific \"Copyright (c) Year Author\" lines required by the license. 3. The License Hub Access the central dashboard via Window > License Manager > License Hub. Audit Tab View every LicenseLink currently active in your project. Identify \"unlicensed\" gaps in your project hierarchy. Use the Ping and View buttons to locate specific assets or licenses. Export Tab Export ThirdPartyNotices.txt / CREDITS.md: Compile every unique license and note into a single file. Auto-Deduplication: If multiple folders use the same license asset, Attributo lists the legal text only once in the export. 4. Troubleshooting & FAQ Why didn't the window pop up? Attributo ignores native Unity files (e.g. .mat, .anim, .asset) and anything under Packages/ to reduce noise. Scripts (.cs) and asmdefs are also ignored. Can I license a single file? Attributo is folder-based. Assigning a license to a folder covers everything inside it. Does this work in builds? No. Attributo is Editor-only. It has no impact on game performance or build size. 5. Legal Disclaimer IMPORTANT: Attributo is an organizational aid and does not constitute legal advice. You are solely responsible for ensuring that all assets are correctly attributed and that license terms are followed. Always manually review your exported attribution file before shipping your project."
